These are the reshade shaders made by me, please excuse me if they seems unprofessional, I'm just an econometrist who likes to code occasionally.

these shaders all use ReShadeUI.fxh ReShade.fxh cImageProcessing.fxh as prerequisits, make sure you have them installed.
HDA_LA_3.png is also required, this is from the noise pack at	https://momentsingraphics.de/BlueNoise.html , also includes a neat explanation of blue noise.
